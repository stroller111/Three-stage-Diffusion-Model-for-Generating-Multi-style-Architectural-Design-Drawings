This repository includes the following folders:

OriginalImage&BasicContour: It contains the original images and the generated basic contour images.

SceneImageReferenceï¼šIt stores various reference images, which are used to generate the images in the second stage.

FirstStage: It includes the images generated in the first stage.

SecondStage: It includes the images generated in the second stage.

ThirdStage: It includes the images generated in the third stage.

Code: It contains the Python code used for experimental comparison. The python code filename is "fid60.py". You can execute it by running "python fid60.py" to generate the data file "fid_scores.csv".

ResultAnalysis: It includes the experimental data and statistical line charts. The statistical filename is "fid_scores.xlsx"
